# ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy

If you already run an [ESPHome Bluetooth proxy](https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy.html) mesh for Home Assistant, BLE Scale Sync can reuse it as its BLE radio. No dedicated ESP32 with custom firmware, no MQTT broker plumbing: the server connects to the ESPHome Native API on port 6053 and subscribes to BLE advertisements directly.

::: tip Broadcast and GATT supported
The ESPHome proxy transport handles both broadcast scales (parsed straight from advertisements) and GATT scales (connected on demand through the proxy, then read and disconnected). Multiple proxies can be configured for a mesh: a GATT connect is routed to the proxy that most recently saw the scale, with the others as fallbacks. Implemented in [issue #116](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/issues/116).
:::

## How it works

```
┌───────┐  BLE   ┌─────────────┐  Native API  ┌────────────────┐
│ Scale │ ─────► │ ESPHome BT  │ ──(6053)──► │ BLE Scale Sync │
└───────┘ advert │   proxy     │              │  Docker/Node   │
                 └─────────────┘              └────────────────┘
```

The ESPHome proxy sees the scale's BLE advertisement, wraps it in a Native API `BluetoothLEAdvertisementResponse`, and forwards it to BLE Scale Sync. The server matches scale adapters against the advertisement (manufacturer data, service UUIDs, local name), parses the broadcast frame, and dispatches the reading to exporters. No local Bluetooth adapter is required on the machine running BLE Scale Sync.

## Requirements

- A running ESPHome device with `bluetooth_proxy:` enabled, on ESPHome **2023.5 or newer** (older firmware used a different BLE event layout that is not handled by this transport)
- Network reachability between BLE Scale Sync and the ESPHome device on TCP port 6053
- Either the ESPHome API encryption key (recommended) or the legacy API password, matching the device's `api:` config

::: tip When to pick this vs the ESP32 MQTT proxy
Both transports support broadcast and GATT scales. If you already have ESPHome proxies in your home, start here: zero new hardware. The [ESP32 MQTT proxy](/guide/esp32-proxy) additionally offers a display/beep feedback UI.

## Configuring BLE Scale Sync

Add the `ble` section to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
ble:
  handler: esphome-proxy
  esphome_proxy:
    host: ble-proxy.local # IP or mDNS name of the ESPHome device
    port: 6053 # default, matches ESPHome `api.port`
    encryption_key: '${ESPHOME_API_KEY}' # 32-byte base64 PSK from your api: config
    # password: '${ESPHOME_API_PASSWORD}' # legacy plaintext auth, use encryption_key instead
    client_info: ble-scale-sync # visible in ESPHome logs / Home Assistant
```

Restart BLE Scale Sync. In continuous mode the server keeps the Native API connection open, subscribes once, and processes advertisements as they arrive.

### Getting the encryption key

In your ESPHome device YAML:

```yaml
api:
  encryption:
    key: 'Lw1vKZ...YOUR_BASE64_KEY...cG=='
```

Use the exact same key in `esphome_proxy.encryption_key`. If you use `secrets.yaml`, read the key from the rendered device config in Home Assistant or ESPHome Dashboard.

::: tip Wizard
`npm run setup` includes an interactive ESPHome proxy step that prompts for the host, port and authentication choice.
:::

::: warning Security
The Native API without encryption (plaintext password) transmits scale weight and body composition data in the clear. Always prefer `encryption_key` unless you're isolated on a trusted LAN.
:::

## Docker deployment

The ESPHome proxy transport, like the ESP32 MQTT proxy, removes the need for local Bluetooth on the host. The container can run without BlueZ, D-Bus mounts, or `NET_ADMIN`:

```yaml
# docker-compose.esphome-proxy.yml
services:
  ble-scale-sync:
    image: ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest
    container_name: ble-scale-sync
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml
      - garmin-tokens:/app/garmin-tokens
    environment:
      - CONTINUOUS_MODE=true
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  garmin-tokens:
```

## Troubleshooting

### Timed out connecting to ESPHome proxy

- Check the host and port are reachable: `nc -zv <host> 6053`
- If you use `encryption_key`, make sure it matches the device's `api.encryption.key` exactly (base64, 44 characters ending in `=`)
- If you use `password`, note that newer ESPHome builds remove plaintext auth, switch to `encryption_key`

### GATT scale not read over the proxy

Both broadcast and GATT scales work over the ESPHome proxy. On connect the
handler logs a one-time capability summary naming each configured adapter and
whether it is serviced by broadcast or by an on-demand GATT connection. A GATT
scale is connected only when it advertises (it wakes when you step on it), read
via the proxy, then disconnected so no proxy connection slot is held between
weigh-ins.

If a GATT scale still does not produce readings:

- **Connection slots:** an ESP32 proxy has a limited number of active GATT
  connections (configured in your `bluetooth_proxy` / `esp32_ble_tracker`
  YAML). When all proxies are full the read is retried on the next
  advertisement and a one-time warning is logged; free a slot or add another
  proxy via `additional_proxies`.
- **Out of range:** the connect is routed to the proxy that last saw the scale.
  If no proxy is close enough, move a proxy nearer or add one to the mesh.
- Single-shot (`npm start`) returns a descriptive error; continuous mode
  (`CONTINUOUS_MODE=true`) keeps running and retries.
- **ESPHome logs "Missing address type in connect request":** resolved. The
  handler now sends the BLE address type (public or random, taken from the
  scale's advertisement) with every GATT connect, and falls back to the other
  type if the first attempt is refused. Update to the latest version if you
  still see this on older builds.

### Multiple ESPHome proxies (mesh)

Add more proxies under `additional_proxies`; each keeps its own host, port and
auth. Advertisements from every proxy are aggregated, and a GATT connect is
routed to the proxy that saw the scale most recently (RSSI breaks ties), with
the rest as fallbacks.

```yaml
ble:
  handler: esphome-proxy
  esphome_proxy:
    host: proxy1.home
    port: 6053
    encryption_key: '<base64 Noise key>'
    additional_proxies:
      - host: proxy2.home
        encryption_key: '<base64 Noise key>'
      - host: proxy3.home
        password: '<legacy password>'
```

### ESPHome logs show "clientInfo: ble-scale-sync"

That's expected. The `client_info` field is how ESPHome identifies who's connected. Change it per-instance in `esphome_proxy.client_info` if you run multiple BLE Scale Sync copies.

### Scale is only read on the second weigh-in

Some scales (notably Xiaomi Mi Scale 2) broadcast their final measurement frame in a very brief window: the moment weight and impedance are both stable. The default ESPHome scan parameters listen only ~9% of the time (`window: 30ms / interval: 320ms`), which can miss this window on the first stand.

Fix: increase the scan duty cycle in your ESPHome device YAML:

```yaml
bluetooth_proxy:
  active: true

esp32_ble_tracker:
  scan_parameters:
    interval: 320ms
    window: 300ms # listen ~94% of the time
    active: true
```

Flash the updated firmware to the proxy and restart BLE Scale Sync. This affects all passive-broadcast scales on that proxy: higher duty cycle means more reliable first-try readings.

### "No recognized scales found" in `npm run scan` over ESPHome

- Step on the scale (or press its button) while the scan runs so it begins advertising
- Move closer to the ESPHome proxy. Scale advertisements are low-power and ESPHome proxies have their own range limits
- Confirm Home Assistant sees the scale's advertisements via the same proxy; if HA also misses them, the proxy itself is out of range
