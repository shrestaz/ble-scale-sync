## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Linux)

```bash
# Configure
docker run --rm -it --network host --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_RAW \
  --group-add 112 -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus:ro \
  -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml \
  -v ./garmin-tokens:/app/garmin-tokens \
  ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest setup

# Run (continuous mode, auto-restart)
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --network host \
  --cap-add NET_ADMIN --cap-add NET_RAW \
  --group-add 112 --device /dev/rfkill \
  -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus:ro \
  -v ./config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro \
  -v ./garmin-tokens:/app/garmin-tokens \
  -e CONTINUOUS_MODE=true \
  ghcr.io/kristianp26/ble-scale-sync:latest
```

Ideal for Raspberry Pi, NAS, and headless servers. Works alongside any Home Assistant install (Container, Core, OS) via MQTT auto-discovery. Your data never leaves your network.

### Option 2: Home Assistant Add-on

Running Home Assistant **OS** or **Supervised**? One click and skip the CLI entirely.

[![Add BLE Scale Sync repository to your Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FKristianP26%2Fble-scale-sync)

The badge opens your Home Assistant instance, confirms the repository, and lands you on the Add-on Store with **BLE Scale Sync** ready to install.

The add-on handles config through the UI, auto-detects the Mosquitto broker for Home Assistant auto-discovery, and bootstraps Garmin tokens on first start. See the [Home Assistant Add-on guide](/guide/home-assistant-addon) for the full option reference, MFA workaround, and custom config mode.

::: warning
Add-ons are not available on **HA Container** or **HA Core** installs (no Supervisor). Use Option 1 instead.
:::

### Option 3: Standalone (Node.js, Linux/macOS/Windows)

Runs natively on all major desktop and server operating systems. No containers, no Supervisor required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync.git
cd ble-scale-sync && npm install
npm run setup    # interactive wizard: scale discovery, user profile, exporters
CONTINUOUS_MODE=true npm start   # always-on, listens for scale indefinitely
```

Requires Node.js v22+ and a BLE adapter. For always-on deployments, create a systemd service:

::: details Example: /etc/systemd/system/ble-scale.service

```ini
[Unit]
Description=BLE Scale Sync
After=network.target bluetooth.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/ble-scale-sync
EnvironmentFile=/home/pi/ble-scale-sync/.env
Environment="CONTINUOUS_MODE=true"
Environment="PATH=/home/pi/ble-scale-sync/venv/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now ble-scale.service
```

:::

::: tip Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
The ideal setup: a [~15€ single-board computer](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) with built-in BLE, always on, always listening. Step on the scale and your data appears in Garmin Connect within seconds. No phone needed. Note: the original Pi Zero W (ARMv6) is [not supported](/troubleshooting#install-fails-on-raspberry-pi-zero-w-first-gen).
:::

::: tip Two ways to connect your scale
**Local BLE** (any of the options above): the server has a Bluetooth adapter and talks to the scale directly. Needs BlueZ/D-Bus on Linux, or native BLE on macOS/Windows.

**Remote BLE via ESP32**: a cheap ~8€ ESP32 board sits near the scale and relays BLE data over WiFi/MQTT. The server needs no Bluetooth at all, which makes Docker deployment much simpler (no `NET_ADMIN`, no D-Bus mounts). See the [ESP32 BLE Proxy guide](/guide/esp32-proxy).
